#Todo List
    
Players could hold more than one Ticket in their wallet. 
Since these tokens are unique there is a need to select an individual tokens for gameplay. 
At the moment only one token seems to be playable/redeemable/burnable.
Only when the first token is burned (or moved to another wallet) the next one can be used.
Maybe this problem needs to be moved to the front-end interface?
